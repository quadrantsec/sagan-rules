This is the Git repository for the Sagan engine rule sets.  You 
probably won't find these useful unless you're actually using Sagan!

What is Sagan? 
--------------

Sagan is an open source (GNU/GPLv2) high performance, real-time log 
analysis & correlation engine.  It is written in C and uses a 
multi-threaded architecture to deliver high performance log & event 
analysis. The Sagan structure and Sagan rules work similarly to the 
Sourcefire "Snort" and "Suricata" IDS engine. This was intentionally 
done to maintain compatibility with rule management software 
(oinkmaster/pulledpork/etc) and allows Sagan to correlate log events 
with your Suricata/Snort IDS/IPS systems.
